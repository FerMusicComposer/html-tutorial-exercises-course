			Then, you start talking about some interesting stuff that nobody wants to read <br />
			Then you can quote someone to add credibility: <br />
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			A quotation is a hanfy thing to have about, saving one the trouble <br />
			of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business <br />

			- A.A. Milne, If I May
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new <br />
			generations have things in common
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the span of attention of a bird</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to bullet points</li>
		</ul>
